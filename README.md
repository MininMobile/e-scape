A "hacker" game where you have to escape from a terminal-based system.

Your memory has been wiped, and your goal is to find out what happened.

You're trapped inside a computer, your computer has a fully-functional file system, the ability to access a sort of emulated 'internet', plenty of built in terminal commands and programs and the ability to write and execute scripts to automate certain functions.
